# Machine Learning Algorithms
> Algorithms written for foundations of machine learning class at AMMI

This repo contains Jupyter notebooks implementing various machine learning algorithms you will come across as you start your machine learning journey. Most are implemented as python classes which encapsulate all the various parts of the algorithm.

## Getting started

To learn more about the algorithms, you may require to start with a machine learning book. I wrote a [Foundations of Machine Learning Note](https://github.com/ogunlao/foundations-of-machine-learning-notes/blob/master/foundations_of_ml.pdf) during my course which might be helpful.

To get a copy of the notebooks, run the following command in your terminal;

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ogunlao/foundations_of_ml
```

The code above fetches the `ammi-ml` repository and renames it to `foundations_of_ml` in your current directory.

## Algorithms covered

- Advanced Numpy - Just to get comfortable with some numpy concepts
- Model Selection Algorithm - Backward Selection

Most algorithms use numpy and scipy internally for vectorized implementations. Note that these algorithms are not optimized for deployment but serve to explain the concepts in a clear way. For deployment, check out the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) python library for a start.
